sic - simple irc client
=======================
sic is an extremely fast, small and simple irc client.  It reads commands from
standard input and prints all server output to standard output. It multiplexes
also all channel traffic into one output so that you don't have to switch
different channel buffers: that's actually a feature.


Installation
------------
Edit the Makefile or override the flags to match your local setup. sic is
installed into /usr/local by default.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sic 
(if necessary as root):

	$ make
	# make install


Running sic
-----------
Simply invoke the 'sic' command with the required arguments.
